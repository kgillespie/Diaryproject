page:Tuesday:Tuesday morning I wake up and get a text from Ella and it says "I'm moving to Ireland next week." I was shocked as Ella and I had never talked about her wanting to move. My next thought was asking her why but I assumed it was because of Willy. They had been dating for two years on and off. Willy never seemed like the type of person to take life seriously and he always found excuse to not be in a relationship with Ella. However, Ella was to blinded by love to see that he was not good for her.:2023-03-08 01:11:28.517628:
