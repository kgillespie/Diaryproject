Objective: Create a diary application that allows users to create and manage different diaries.

Required Modules:
Main Module (main.py)-- This will be the driver script which will interact with the user.
Requirements:
When launched, the user should be able to specify the diary to create or the diary that should be opened. (E.g., if the user provides the name of an existing diary, then the dairy is opened.)
If the diary is new, a new diary file should be created for storing diary info and pages.
If the diary is a previous diary, the application should open the diary with all of its content. 
The application should allow the user to perform various actions on the diary and the pages within the diary:
Diary level operations/actions: 
Add new page
Find existing page(s)
Display pages in the diary
Remove page(s) from the diary
Save diary (and associated pages)
Reload (restore from last saved version)
Diary Page level operations/actions:
Set Title 
Set/Update content
Display content
Save page

Dairy Module (diary.py) -- This module will define the Diary and Diary Page classes and provide the implementations for them.
You will need to create 2 Python classes:

The diary info entry should be read and the values stored into the appropriate data members of the Diary object.
Each diary entry should be read from the file and used to create a Diary Page object for each stored entry.
